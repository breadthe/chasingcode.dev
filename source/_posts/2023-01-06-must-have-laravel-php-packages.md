**UPDATED January 19, 2023**

A list of Laravel and PHP packages I **absolutely** need in every project, continuously updated.

This list is relatively short because I follow the principle "avoid packages until it hurts". I use packages that encapsulate complex functionality and features that would take too long to implement from scratch. I also heavily favor those that are well maintained, which is why you'll see a lot of Spatie ones on the list.

## Must-have

* [livewire/livewire](https://github.com/livewire/livewire) - Laravel Livewire.
* [wire-elements/modal](https://github.com/wire-elements/modal) - Wire Elements Modal, a modal component for Laravel Livewire.

* [opcodesio/log-viewer](https://github.com/opcodesio/log-viewer) - Easy-to-use, fast, and beautiful log viewer for Laravel apps.
* [barryvdh/laravel-debugbar](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar) **dev** - Laravel Debugbar.
* [spatie/laravel-ray](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-ray) **dev** - Laravel adapter for Ray.
