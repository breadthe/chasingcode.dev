I wanted to write an "Intro to GeoJSON" but Daniel Imfeld [Mastodon](https://techhub.social/@dimfeld) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dimfeld) beat me to it with an article that is hard to top. Instead, I'll use this space to add any resources around GeoJSON.

GeoJSON is an open source spatial data format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures. I became aware of it just last week when I started building my newest side project, [Seismic](/blog/seismic-desktop-taskbar-app-usgs-earthquake-tracking/).

## GeoJSON resources

* [Introduction to GeoJSON](https://imfeld.dev/writing/introduction_to_geojson) by Daniel Imfeld.
* [GeoJSON on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON)
* [GeoJSON.io](https://geojson.io/#map=2/0/20) - A simple tool for visualizing, editing, and sharing maps, with GeoJSON and other formats.
