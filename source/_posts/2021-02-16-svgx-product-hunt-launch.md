[SVGX](https://svgx.app/), the Electron-Svelte app I've been working on for close to a year, is finally on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/svgx).

To recap, *SVGX is an offline desktop SVG icon & asset manager for designers and developers*. I made it to make my life working with SVG graphics easier.

SVGX is free to download and use, but I'm experimenting with monetization in the form of selling access to the source code. I call this model [Gitware](/blog/gitware-new-software-distribution-model).

Get the app from the link above, and please vote for it on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/svgx)!

That is all! ðŸŽ‰
