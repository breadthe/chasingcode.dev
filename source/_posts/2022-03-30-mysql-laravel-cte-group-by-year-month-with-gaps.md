Following up on my previous article on [grouping data using MySQL Common Table Expressions](/blog/mysql-cte-group-by-year-month-with-gaps/), I am offering an implementation of the same technique in Laravel.

**Note** This requires MySQL v8.0+.

## Recap - The original Eloquent query

Grouping total distance by year-month (e.g. `2016-03`) for a specific bike is pretty straightforward...

```php
$ridesByYearMonth = 
    DB::table('rides')
        ->select(
            'start_date',
            DB::raw('SUM(distance) AS total_distance'),
        )
        ->where([
            'user_id' => $userId,
            'bike_id' => $bikeId,
        ])
        ->groupBy('start_date')
        ->orderBy('start_date')
        ->get();
```

... but it doesn't return gaps for months without rides.

## Option 1 - ðŸ“¦ Use the staudenmeir/laravel-cte package

There's a Laravel package for everything, and CTEs are no exception. [laravel-cte](https://github.com/staudenmeir/laravel-cte) is a popular, well maintained package that offers an Eloquent-like syntax for Common Table Expressions across the most popular SQL databases.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to figure out how to use this package in the short time I dedicated to it. Here's an [article](https://johnathansmith.com/laravel-mysql-cte/) that might shed some light.

## Option 2 - ðŸ§€ Cheese it with raw SQL

Personally I like to keep dependencies to a bare minimum. In this case, the same outcome can be achieved with raw SQL, though it won't look as clean as using the package. Here's how this looks in Laravel:

```php
$user_id = 1;
$bike_id = 100;
$bindings = [$user_id, $bike_id, $user_id, $bike_id, $user_id, $bike_id];

$query = "
WITH RECURSIVE dates (
	date
) AS (
	SELECT
		DATE(LAST_DAY(MIN(start_date)))
	FROM
		rides
	WHERE
		user_id = ?
		AND bike_id = ?
	UNION ALL
	SELECT
		DATE(LAST_DAY(date)) + INTERVAL 1 MONTH
	FROM
		dates
	WHERE
		DATE(LAST_DAY(date)) <= (
			SELECT
				DATE(MAX(start_date))
			FROM
				rides
			WHERE
				user_id = ?
				AND bike_id = ?)
)
SELECT
	DATE_FORMAT(date, '%Y-%m') AS 'year_month', COALESCE(total_distance, 0) AS total_distance
FROM
	dates
	LEFT JOIN (
		SELECT
			DATE_FORMAT(start_date, '%Y-%m') AS yearmonth,
			SUM(distance) AS total_distance
		FROM
			rides
		WHERE
			user_id = ?
			AND bike_id = ?
		GROUP BY
			DATE_FORMAT(start_date, '%Y-%m')
    ) AS rides ON DATE_FORMAT(date, '%Y-%m') = yearmonth;
";

$ridesByYearMonthArray = DB::connection()
    ->select($query, $bindings); // returns an array

$ridesByYearMonthCollection = collect($ridesByYearMonthArray); // cast to collection
```

I'm not very happy with how I pass the query bindings (same pair of ids repeated 3 times), but it does the job. You should also consider doing extra validation and casting on those bindings to prevent garbage data.

`DB::select(...)` also works.

## Conclusion

I hope Laravel will have first class support for Common Table Expressions at some point in the future, but for now these two techniques should suffice.
