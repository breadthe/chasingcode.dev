If you identify as human (or dabble in any form of programming), chances are you like to play video games. I love video games, in particular on the PC. I've played games non-stop since I laid hands on my first computer.

Take that, parents who thought that I would spend the rest of my life in front of a computer and become a total failure! That first part of the prophecy was certainly fulfilled. As for the second, well, I didn't end up a *total* failure. I fail now and then, just like everyone else.

The point is that games remain as important as ever in my life. The only (1st world) problem is that there are so *damn many of them*! This year alone I must have bought 20 new games, most of them small, scrappy, indie, in early access.

You see, I've become particularly fond of indie games. I find a lot of them more innovative than AAA games, despite their flaws, glitches, and bugs. They are also very affordable. Compare a $10 indie game with a ton of satisfying gameplay to a $70 behemoth from a well-known studio coughblizzardcough that falls flat after a few hours. The big developers have lost the plot, and the indie developers are eating their lunch.

The idea of making a game has been ruminating in my head for a very long time. It's hard to get started though. What kind of game to make? What technologies to use? How seriously should I take it?

As web developers we don't often realize that other branches of programming are much tougher. Systems programming, embedded programming, game programming - they all require a different mindset and set of skills. For a web developer it might take a while to become productive in this new paradigm.

Game programming, by all accounts, isn't trivial. I really admire single developers or tiny teams who've managed to create a successful game. It speaks to their skill and grit and vision, and I find it aspirational.

Here's where I want to encourage everyone to consider making a game, no matter how shitty. It'll stimulate different parts of your brain, and it'll force you to find solutions for novel problems that are uncommon in your line of work.

As I write this, I'm wrapping up a little browser game I cooked up over the last few weeks. I hope to publish it soon, so stay tuned!
