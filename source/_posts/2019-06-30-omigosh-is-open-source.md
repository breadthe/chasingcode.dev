What better way to give back to the amazing open-source (and especially Laravel) community than to unlock the code behind [Omigo.sh](https://omigo.sh/)?

To iterate, Omigo.sh is built on TightenCo's Jigsaw static site generator, which is itself built on top of Laravel. Starting today, you can freely peruse the code and customizations I made to the site and blog. [Omigo.sh on Github](https://github.com/breadthe/omigo.sh).

This was a very obvious move, and I only regret not opening it up from the beginning. One day I had a "doh!" moment and realized that there's no benefit in keeping it in a private repo, but everything to gain by making the sourcecode freely available.
