Welcome, yet again, to another incarnation of my blog and personal site. If you've arrived here directly, you may not be aware that I transferred this blog from a different site called [omigo.sh](https://omigo.sh). It is part of my personality that I change my mind occasionally. As I acquire new information, knowledge, and experience I try to optimize.

Initially I meant to use Omigo.sh as a central hub - or an umbrella organization if you will - for my side projects. I also blogged from the same site, but there was no personal information about me. Over time I decided I was going to be more transparent about who I am and what I do, so I made [chasingcode.dev](https://chasingcode.dev) as a hybrid portfolio/resume website.

Once I made that decision, it made sense to transfer the blog over. Now all my articles from Omigo.sh are permanently redirected here.

If you skipped the home page, [check it out](https://chasingcode.dev) and learn more about me. I'm planning more content aside from the blog itself, to expand and dive deeper into what makes me tick.

Thanks for visiting and I hope you'll find something useful here!
