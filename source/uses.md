description: Hardware, software, and gear I use on a daily basis
---

A comprehensive list of my favorite hardware, software, and gear, from the perspective of a Laravel/PHP and Vue/Svelte/JavaScript full stack developer, updated for **2020**.

## Work hardware

I prefer coding on Macs, exclusively. While I've coded successfully on PCs, I find that I'm a lot more productive, have a lot less frustrations, and my dev tools just work on a Mac.

- Day job laptop: [2019 MacBook Pro 16"](https://amzn.to/33A3Hmm) 2.4 GHz 8-core Intel Core i9, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD
- Personal laptop: [2020 MacBook Air M1](https://amzn.to/3k7K3Xe) 8-core GPU, 16GB RAM, 512 GB SSD

## Mac peripherals/accessories

- Wireless keyboard: [Apple Magic Keyboard 2](https://amzn.to/2y01l4D) - best coding keyboard I've ever used
- Wireless trackpad: [Apple Magic Trackpad 2](https://amzn.to/33Chitn) - Apple has the best trackpad implementation of any manufacturer, and the wireless one is an absolute must for trackpad fans
- USB-C dongle (for 16" Mac): [VAVA USB-C Hub](https://amzn.to/3dpKOaz) 8-in-1 4K HDMI, 1Gbps RJ45 ethernet port, USB 3.0, SD/TF card reader, 100W charging port
- 2020 M1 MacBook Air case: [IBENZER New 2020 MacBook Air 13 inch Case M1 A2337 A2179 A1932](https://amzn.to/2ZDtclu) - excellent transparent case that shows off the Mac chassis. Comes with a screen protector that is fairly easy to install, as well as a silicone keyboard skin thin enough to make typing feel natural
- 16" MacBook Pro case: [MOSISO MacBook Pro 16 inch Case, Crystal Clear](https://amzn.to/3bdWmLZ) - while the laptop was purchased by the company I work for, I wanted to protect it with a case as well as being able to put whatever stickers I want on it. I'm very happy with this case - it also comes with a screen protector and a keyboard cover if you're into that sort of thing. 

## Mac/development software

- üíµ IDE: **PHPStorm** - best IDE I've ever used, period. Has a ton of conveniences built in for great productivity. It's not free (nor expensive) but the price of entry is more than justified.
- Code editor: **VSCode** - seems like everyone is using VSCode these days, for everything. It may be the best text editor in the world but it is not an *IDE* and it doesn't hold a candle to PHPStorm for PHP work, even with a bajillion extensions. I use it for non-PHP work, such as 100% JavaScript projects, Markdown, etc.
- Terminal: **iTerm2** - the old faithful. It's fast and has everything I need: tabs, panes, themes, etc.
- Shell: **zsh** with [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and the [Powerlevel9k theme](https://github.com/Powerlevel9k/powerlevel9k)
- Coding fonts: **JetBrains Mono**, **Fira Code**
- Favorite browser: **Firefox**
- Design/vector: **Figma**, **GravitDesigner**
- Presentation: **Apple Keynote**
- Project management: **Trello** - I use it to manage my side-projects. I love the simplicity and the slickness of the UI. Too bad it got acquired by Atlassian (I hate all their products), but I hope it stays the way it is.
- üíµ [Tinkerwell](https://tinkerwell.app/) - probably the best tool to come out of the Laravel/PHP ecosystem. An offline REPL tool that you can use for rapid prototyping, and testing/validating PHP code snippets. At $15 it's dirt cheap for how much it has boosted my Laravel productivity.
- üíµ [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/) - I was lucky to buy the Pro version on sale and it's the best $20 I ever spent on software. It has most of Photoshop's features in an offline, truly affordable package, with a simple UI and familiar key mappings.
- [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) - offline documentation for the developer technology of your choice. Invaluable when traveling or when you don't have internet access.
- Window manager: [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) - apparently there are better window managers but I got used to this one and it works fine for me.
- Keyboard rebinding: [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) - if there's one thing I miss on the Mac is middle-button click to open links in a new tab or to close a tab. I use Karabiner to remap the Caps Lock key to act as a middle-click. So if I hover over a link and tap Caps, it will open the link in a new tab. Likewise, Caps over a tab will close it.
- [Vanilla](https://matthewpalmer.net/vanilla/) - hides the menu bar icons that you don't need to see all the time.  
- [Kap](https://getkap.co/) - a tiny screen capture utility. I use it a lot for capturing animated portions of my screen, as [explained here](/blog/screen-recording-gif-workflow/).

## X-platform software

- üíµ **Spotify**
- üíµ **1Password**
- Google **Docs**
- Google **Keep**

## Gaming/entertainment hardware

I am a PC gamer thru & thru. I've never owned a console of any kind, and likely never will. I hand-build all my PCs, every 5 years or so.

- Motherboard: [ASUS Prime Z390-A](https://amzn.to/2WzTOns) LGA1151
- CPU: [Intel i5 9600K](https://amzn.to/398tjYL) 6-core 4.6GHz
- Fan/heatsink: [Noctua NH-D15](https://amzn.to/2U8yALB)
- RAM: [Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB](https://amzn.to/2U94N5D) (2x8GB) DDR4 3000MHz (PC4-24000)
- GPU: [EVGA nVidia GTX 1080Ti FTW3 Gaming](https://amzn.to/3bk382X) 11GB GDDR5
- PSU: [Corsair AX760 760W](https://amzn.to/2QBdkfz) 80 PLUS PLATINUM
- Primary drive: [Samsung 500GB 970 EVO](https://amzn.to/2UqV3lZ) NVMe M.2 SSD
- Gaming drive: [Samsung¬†500GB 850 Evo](https://amzn.to/33ANgGB) SSD - I keep my games on a separate SSD from my main/boot drive
- Data drives: 3x internal HDDs of various sizes 
- Blu-Ray burner: [Pioneer 15x Blu-ray Burner](https://amzn.to/3bhDBHz) SATA internal 
- Case: Corsair Carbide 400R Mid-Tower
- OS: Windows 10

## PC peripherals

- Monitor: [Asus ROG Swift PG349Q 34‚Äù](https://amzn.to/2Ur3nCu) Curved G-Sync Gaming Monitor 120Hz 3440 X 1440 IPS - my monitor is actually a slightly older version of this, that only goes to 100Hz but it doesn't matter because I'm one of those who can't tell the difference. I use it for both gaming and work and it has been amazing for over 3 years now. On Mac, for example, I can easily split it into 3 columns using Spectacle. Combined with my laptop's screen, it's like having 4 monitors.
- Keyboard: [Logitech G810](https://amzn.to/2Ure1sR) Orion Spectrum RGB mechanical - can't really recommend this keyboard, even if it were still produced. It was overpriced and it doesn't use Cherry switches, rather Logitech's own implementation. I find it bad for typing but OK for gaming.
- Mouse: [Logitech G305 Lightspeed](https://amzn.to/2UcO15I) Wireless Gaming Mouse - I'm one of those gamers who prefers a minimum amount of buttons. The G305 is light and lag free.
- Mouse pad: [Yicaihong Metal Aluminum](https://amzn.to/3dlCwAf) Medium 9.45X7.87 Inch - great, inexpensive, solid, compact, dual-surface pad. I use the synthetic leather side which has really good traction, whether for gaming or otherwise.
- Wireless headphones: **Sennheiser RS 180** digital wireless headphones - I've had these for over 5 years and, while initially pricy, they've paid for themselves many times over. I use them daily on my PC for everything that produces sound - movies, music, youtube, games, etc. The closest modern equivalents are [Sennheiser RS 185](https://amzn.to/2U9Elsn) or [Sennheiser RS 175](https://amzn.to/3aaUN1p).

## PC software

- üíµ [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/) - cloud backup. Very inexpensive for the peace of mind it offers. I use it to backup my PC where I keep lots of "important" data such as photos, documents, and other digital junk. It has literally saved my ü•ì a few years back when my main data HDD died and I was able to restore everything from the cloud. I do keep offline backups as well but cloud backup is just one facet of a comprehensive strategy.
- üíµ [Cyberghost VPN](https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/) - dare I call this the best VPN ever? I've been using it for years and it has delivered in spades: inexpensive (if you buy a multi-year plan it ends up being < $3 / month), fast (I get almost the same speeds as I would without it), vast choice of country IPs, and incorporated outside the US for extra peace of mind.

## Phone

- **Samsung Galaxy Note 8** - Despite my love for Macs, I've never been a huge fan of iPhones/iOS. The Note 8 is the best phone for me at the moment. It may be several generations behind modern phones but I love the stylus and how well Samsung integrated it with the software. The battery and speed are still good, it has a headphone jack, and it takes decent photos. I'm planning to hang on to it for as long as possible, especially considering the initial price. After that it gets tricky. I would very much like to continue having a stylus, but I don't like the direction Samsung is following with their phones, and the prices are becoming ridiculous. There's a chance I may switch to an iPhone in the future.

## Other gear & accessories

- Standing desk: [ApexDesk Elite Series](https://amzn.to/2QE6buW) 71" wide, electrically adjustable. Fun fact: I've never once used it in the standing position.
- Soundbar: [TaoTronics Gaming Computer Speaker](https://amzn.to/2vD9yuC) - I bought this sound bar to use it with my Mac but it's the first TaoTronics device that disappoints. I suppose the sound is somewhat better and louder than the MacBook speakers but it has too many issues to recommend.
- Headphones: [TaoTronics Active Noise Cancelling Headphones](https://amzn.to/2J3nBgi) - pretty happy with these. I use them almost daily and they do a passable job for what I paid. The noise cancelling is decent for a moderately noisy environment and so is the sound quality. The battery lasts all day too.
- Lamp: [TaoTronics LED](https://amzn.to/33CmMEB) Desk Lamp - really good LED lamp. It's light, compact, versatile, and uses touch controls that work really well. Speaking of controls, it has 5 settings each for color temperature (cool -> warm) and brightness. 
- Time machine HDD: [WD Elements 1TB](https://amzn.to/2UyXyTE) - I only need 1TB for my 2015 MacBook Pro backups.
- Backup HDDs: [WD Elements 4TB](https://amzn.to/3bgbCrK) - I use 2 of these for my PC backups. 
- Watch: [Garmin Fenix 5X Sapphire](https://amzn.to/2WwV8Y9) - I wear my watch almost 24/7. It's not a true smart watch, but it's the best option for someone who's into a variety of outdoor activities (cycling, hiking, skiing, occasional swimming and paddle boarding). It displays my phone notifications, has built-in maps and GPS, tracks steps and sleep patterns, the battery lasts almost 2 weeks, and it's super tough to boot.
- Electric duster: [CompuCleaner 2.0](https://amzn.to/2QEc6Qv) - may sound like an odd one, but it's definitely computer-related and an awesome tool for any computer geek's arsenal. Say goodbye to those asthmatic air cans. This baby blows air like a jet engine, and that's just on the low setting! I use it to clean my keyboards, internal components such as the GPU or CPU radiator/fan, the inside of my Macs (you'll be surprised how much dust can build up over time), and so on.
