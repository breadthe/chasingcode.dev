    <h2>Hobbies</h2>

    <p>I'm a big fan of hobbies and I'm grateful that my career allows me to enjoy a wide variety. Here are some of them.</p>

    <x-hobby-item title="⌨️ Coder">I code a lot for fun and to scratch various itches. But you've already seen that.</x-hobby-item>

    <x-hobby-item title="💪 Former weightlifter">My fitness journey started more than 10 years ago with powerlifting, then a mix of bodybuilding and powerlifting. I did it mostly for aesthetics but also got strong and learned how to manipulate my weight and body composition. I quit the gym during Covid and moved on to other activities. This period had a huge impact on the rest of my life, and I still use the knowledge I gained back then.</x-hobby-item>

    <x-hobby-item title="🚲 Cyclist">I followed up with cycling for the next few years. I couldn't get enough of mountain biking, road, and gravel. I worked hard at improving my skills across all disciplines. My claim to fame is a 107 mile (172 km) road ride and weekly 65 mile (100+ km) gravel rides. At my peak I was riding well over 6000 miles a year (10,000+ km). I still ride a lot, but not as much as I used to.</x-hobby-item>

    <x-hobby-item title="🏃 Runner">I've only been running since 2023 but in this short time I worked my way up from "couch" to marathon. I've always associated running with knee pain and injuries, but to my surprise pain and injuries went away the more I ran. At the same time I was able to increase my mileage and pave. I thought I might run a marathon one day, I just didn't think it would happen in less than a year of non-specific training. I love running now and do it almost every day.</x-hobby-item>

    <x-hobby-item title="🏊 Swimmer">Alongside running, I started swimming in 2023. I'm in a much better place now, having greatly improved my technique and endurance. All that by watching YouTube videos and applying the theory in real life.</x-hobby-item>

    <x-hobby-item title="⛷ Skier">I've been skiing since I was a kid. I only got better as an adult. I wish I could ski more, but it's difficult in Illinois. If I could only pick one sport for the rest of my life, it would probably be skiing.</x-hobby-item>

    <x-hobby-item title="📖 Reader">I'm a reader of things. I read books, articles, and documentation. I read about all the things that interest me. I wish I had more time to read books, but I try to crunch a little each day. Sometimes I feel like reading comics.</x-hobby-item>

    <x-hobby-item title="🕹 Gamer">I've always been a gamer. I play games mostly on the PC, but also on the Nintendo Switch. I'm a fan of single player RPGs and sandbox games in general. I've been playing a lot of indie games lately because it turns out a lot of them are much better than AAA games.</x-hobby-item>
