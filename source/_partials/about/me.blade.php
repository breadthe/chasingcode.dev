    <h2>Me (the webmaster)</h2>

    <p>Hello, I'm Constantin.</p>

    <p>
        I am a full-stack <strong>PHP</strong> developer. I live in Illinois USA, but I hail from Europe.
    </p>

    <p>
        From a very early age I've been fascinated with computers, which led me to pursue a degree in <strong>Computer Science</strong>. Later, I fell in love with <strong>web development</strong> and never looked back.
    </p>

    <p>
        If I could only pick one encompassing technology, it would be the <strong>TALL stack</strong> (Laravel, Livewire, Alpine, Tailwind) with an <strong>SQLite</strong> database.
    </p>

    <p>
        Currently I work full time remote as a <strong>Laravel</strong> developer, helping a <strong>SaaS</strong> start-up to grow.
