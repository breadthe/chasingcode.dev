        <div class="post font-light text-gray-900 tracking-wide pb-4" v-pre>
            <p>I found myself strolling down memory lane recently when I recalled my first big side project from over 10 years ago, and dug it up on the <a href="http://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a>. The nostalgia hit hard, and I decided to write this piece as a tribute to my past self for making it, and the fun times that were had in the process.</p>

<h2>What ~~is~~ was BankAlt?</h2>

<p>BankAlt was a website hosted at <strong>bankalt.com</strong>, and its primary raison d'être was to facilitate the crafting process in World of Warcraft. 10+ years ago I used to be very involved in the game, and one of my trademarks was making lots of gold from gathering, crafting, and trading.</p>

<p>BankAlt is beautifully (but not entirely, for reasons I'll mention below) <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130716130923/http://bankalt.com/">preserved</a> at the Web Archive (aka Wayback Machine).</p>

<h2>The tech behind BankAlt</h2>

<p>I have always been a PHP dev, so it stands to reason that the LAMP stack would power my first big side project.</p>

<ul>
<li>vanilla PHP 5.x (no framework)</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li><a href="https://www.datatables.net/">jQuery datatables</a> with server-side fetching</li>
<li>vanilla CSS (no framework)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Analysis and thoughts</h2>

<p>First, a quick word on BankAlt's state of preservation at the Wayback Machine. The static pages are all there, but the dynamic parts are not. The back-end powering the dynamic data tables is now defunct.</p>

<h3>Purpose &amp; motivation</h3>

<p>My initial purpose of BankAlt was - as it often is - to scratch an itch, and make my life in WoW easier. WoW had, and most likely still does, a complex crafting tree. To craft a high-end item you would have to craft a lot of intermediary items, parts, and materials. But in order to juggle trading, the auction house, crafting, gathering, and make lots of profit in the process, I needed a tool that could automatically calculate the raw materials for any recipe or pattern, as well as the cost of those materials.</p>

<p>I could then use this information to find the best source of raw materials, and then sell the finished product for a hefty profit.</p>

<p>I can't pinpoint what made me build an actual site for this tool, but it must have been a love for World of Warcraft, combined with the desire to create, coupled with the excitement for solving a problem. By that point I had been a web developer for several years, but I had never attempted something of this magnitude.</p>

<h3>Business model</h3>

<p>Making money with BankAlt was definitely not the driving factor, nor was it a big priority later. Back at the time, banner ads were popular, and I thought I could fund the site with ads. That might have worked, had I spent time marketing it and spreading the word. Marketing has always been distasteful to me, so I kept sweeping it under the rug until the very end.</p>

<p>To me, ads are not the most ethical way to monetize a site, but if the product is useful and popular, and enough people are using it, ads can be worthwhile. A very good example is <a href="https://www.photopea.com/">Photopea</a>, which generates impressive revenue for its sole creator.</p>

<p>If I were to do it again today, I would probably use a mix of ads and ad-free premium subscription (with extra perks, of course). I would hold off on ads, though, until the trafic and usage were high enough. Putting ads on an emerging service helps only to drive away potential users.</p>

<h3>RIP BankAlt.com (2010-2013)</h3>

<p>The site ran for approximately 3 years, 2010 - 2013. I'm not even sure if I terminated it in 2013 or 2014. As my interest in WoW waned, I decided to shut it down, since I was barely covering my hosting costs with the small amount of advertising revenue that was coming in.</p>

<h3>Was it worth it?</h3>

<p>BankAlt made very little money, certainly not enough to offset the amount of work I put into it. I don't have any regrets - in fact I'm glad to have stuck with the project for so long. But to me, money is not the driving factor behind a side project, and maybe that's failure on my part. On the other hand, a revenue-generating project could ensure its long term viability, as well as providing motivation to keep hacking on it.</p>

<p>The true worth of this project comes from the fact that it allowed me to sharpen skills on a fun endeavor outside of work. A project like this boosts your confidence as a developer to an immeasurable degree. As BankAlt traffic and active users grew, I would get lots of warm fuzzies inside. This feeling persists even today to an extent.</p>

<p>Looking back, I am very proud to have built BankAlt. Frankly, I am impressed at past me for crafting it to such a high level of care and detail.</p>

<p>Sometimes I regret shutting it down, and I can't help wondering what might have been if I had continued to maintain the project. Realistically, my motivation collapsed soon after I stopped playing WoW, and I don't think I could have forced myself to run a tool I had very little interest in.</p>

<h2>A resurrection?</h2>

<p>While browsing the Web Archive under the influence of nostalgia, a wild thought occurred. Wouldn't it be cool if I could resurrect the site for fun? It would be virtually useless to myself or current World of Warcraft players, but I would be proud to feature it under my portfolio.</p>

<p>The <strong>bankalt.com</strong> domain has long expired, and I do not plan on buying it back. For curiosity, I checked to see if it's available, and I was a little dismayed to find out that it is currently listed for $2900.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2020-11-03-bankalt-com-domain.png" alt="Cost of the bankalt.com domain" /></p>

<p>Consequently, buying the original domain is out of the question. If I do manage to restore the site to a working state, I will host it on one of my other domains. But if you, dear reader, have money burning a hole in your pocket, feel free to buy it back for me 🤑.</p>

<p>So, resurrection. How feasible is it? Until I dig deeper, I would say chances are pretty good. When I shuttered the site, I had the foresight to make multiple backups of the source code and the database.</p>

<p>All I have to do is to restore the database, put the source code in a folder on one of my VPS instances, and point Nginx to <code>index.php</code>. The old site ran on an Apache server, but that shouldn't matter. Hopefully backward compatibility will handle most of the issues.</p>

<p><em>But wait, there's more!</em> I had another wild idea. What if, in addition to resurrecting the original site, I were to rebuild it separately as a modern Laravel app? I think that would be pretty awesome too, just for the learning experience of porting such an old codebase.</p>

<p>This mini-project entails 2 phases:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>phase 1</strong> - restore the original site to its former glory; host it on a vanity sub-domain</li>
<li><strong>phase 2</strong> - rebuild it in Laravel + Livewire or Inertia</li>
</ul>

<p>Both phases are great candidates for how-to articles: "How to revive a legacy PHP application", and "How to rebuild a legacy PHP application in Laravel". Actual titles TBD.</p>

<p>Before I start any of this, I need to work through my side-project backlog and clear a couple of higher priority tasks. Expect phase 1 to commence in the first half of 2021, so stay tuned!</p>

<h2>Screenshots</h2>

<p>While the Wayback Machine keeps archives of all the pages, I wanted to capture those as screenshots and bring them closer to my heart, until - and if - I am able to resurrect BankAlt.</p>
