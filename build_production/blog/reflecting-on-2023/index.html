            <p>In 2019, I started the "tradition" of <a href="/blog/reflecting-on-2019/">reflecting on the past year</a>, mainly from a developer &amp; geek point of view. I think it's a useful tool for summarizing how I've grown as a developer, and what cool new things I've done and accomplished.</p>

<p>I continued this in <a href="/blog/reflecting-on-2020/">2020</a>, <a href="/blog/reflecting-on-2021/">2021</a>, <a href="/blog/reflecting-on-2022/">2022</a>, and now, 2023.</p>

<h2>2023 TL;DR</h2>

<p>🔼 💻 Laravel
🔼 🏃 Running
🔼 🏊‍♂️ Swimming
🔼 🕹️ Gaming
🔼 📚 Reading</p>

<p>🔽 🛠️ Side projects
🔽 🚴‍♂️ Cycling</p>

<h2>🙈 Personal</h2>

<p>As usual, I won't share any personal stuff here.</p>

<p>Thankfully I've been heathy, barring various minor physical sport-related injuries.</p>

<h2>🚧 Work</h2>

<p>In 2023 I changed jobs. I am still full-stack and full-time remote, but in a small SaaS startup this time. It's a great place to be at, and I am happy to be working professionally with Laravel once again.</p>

<h2>📝 This blog</h2>

<p>The blog has now been around for 5 years. As time goes by, the motivation to write diminishes. Or rather, I would like to write more, and sometimes I create article outlines in my head, but when it comes down to actually doing it, I always find better (read "easier") things to do.</p>

<p>In terms of traffic, I decided to check Google Analytics for the first time in years. It turns out that tracking is broken because I haven't implemented GA4 😆 - so broken it shall remain.</p>

<p>Since I'm no longer tracking I don't know which of my articles people liked in 2023, but here are a few that I think are pretty decent:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://chasingcode.dev/blog/how-to-find-owner-of-lost-gopro">How to find the owner of a lost GoPro</a> - Dec 22</li>
</ul>

<h2>🗂️ Personal projects and software releases</h2>

<p>In 2023 I worked less on side projects, especially as the year progressed and I became more involved at work.</p>

<p>Here are some of the personal projects I worked on this year:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/seismic-desktop-taskbar-app-usgs-earthquake-tracking/">Seismic</a> - a desktop taskbar app (only tested on Mac) for tracking earthquakes. Made with Tauri, Svelte, Tailwind CSS.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/react-hooks-in-svelte/">React Hooks in Svelte</a> - a comparison of React hooks vs the Svelte equivalent. Made with SvelteKit + Skeleton UI.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/aqi-desktop-nativephp-app/">AQI Desktop</a> - a very experimental desktop app for tracking the Air Quality Indicator in your zip code. Made with Native PHP + Tailwind CSS.</li>
<li><a href="https://syenite.vercel.app/">Syenite</a> - a super opinionated static blog engine. Still WIP. I would like to use this engine for a future fitness-oriented blog. I could almost tag it 1.0 but you know how that last 10% takes most of the dev time. Made with SvelteKit, TailwindCSS, and a variety of libraries.</li>
</ul>

<h2>💾 New dev tech</h2>

<p>I described my <a href="/blog/2023-programming-stack">2023 stack</a> at the beginning of the year and nothing has changed, except for the fact that I decided to make my own blog engine.</p>

<p>The only new thing that intrigues me this year is <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a>. I wish it existed back in the days of jQuery. Today, however, it's a bit redundant with a Laravel back-end, since Livewire is the perfect equivalent.</p>

<h2>⚙️ New gadgets</h2>

<p>The only new, "big-budget" gadgets I bought this year were both sports-related. A bike computer - <strong>Garmin Edge 840</strong>, and a watch - <strong>Garmin Forerunner 965</strong>. They are both great devices, but the watch is absolutely amazing. It's a bit of a downgrade from a Fenix in terms of durability, but everything else is leagues ahead, and it has helped me take my fitness to new heights.</p>

<h2>⛑️🏃‍♂️ Health and fitness</h2>

<p>Speaking of fitness, 2023 saw my activities shifting towards running, and slightly away from <strong>cycling</strong>. I still ride quite a lot, but running has definitely been the headliner this year.</p>

<p>In 2023 I rode only 5100 miles (8200 km) vs 6400 miles last year.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <strong>running</strong> has become my top fitness activity (at least in terms of enjoyment). It's very ironic since I always dunked on running as being one of the most boring activities in addition to wrecking your knees and joints.</p>

<p>Well, I stuck with it for short distances at first, moving on to longer and longer runs. After a while I really began to enjoy it. I learned a few things that helped me progress: do 80% of your runs at low intensity, run short distances often, and listen to your body for recovery.</p>

<p>A couple of things that contributed to my newfound love for running were the fact that I could listen to a lot of podcasts and music during it (so I didn't get bored), and that it's super convenient to throw on some gear and go for a quick 30-45 minute run every day, at any time. In that respect it's way more convenient than cycling which takes me quite a while of prep before I am ready to go.</p>

<p>As my running fitness increased, so did my distances and paces. My favorite pace at the moment is 9:30 min/mile (5:57 min/km). If you're a seasoned runner this probably doesn't sound like much, but it's a pace that I can run comfortably for miles and miles.</p>

<p>At the same time, I started to enjoy longer distances. My daily 4 mile run became 5 miles and most days I wanted to run more. I ran quite a few half-marathon distances. I thought that sometime in 2024 I would be ready for a <strong>full marathon</strong>. Well, it happened a lot sooner than I had anticipated. One day in early December I decided to go for it and I completed the full distance in 4h 30m. Pretty good for a debutant, especially considering it was a trail run and quite muddy over a long stretch. This was a solo run - not a race.</p>

<p>Also in 2023 I learned how to <strong>swim</strong> properly in terms of technique and endurance, all from watching YouTube videos and applying the theory. So now I'm a much stronger swimmer who can go longer distances without becoming winded.</p>

<p>Health was good otherwise, except for minor sports injuries that recovered quickly.</p>

<h2>📚 Books</h2>

<p>I read more books this years, by applying some discipline in the form of reading one chapter every night before bed. I really enjoyed <strong>The Broken Earth</strong> trilogy by N.K. Jemisin, <strong>Project Hail Mary</strong> by Andy Weir, and an old classic (this time I hope to read the entire series) <strong>Ringworld</strong> by Larry Niven.</p>

<h2>🎬 Movies and TV</h2>

<p>I don't watch TV in the traditional sense, but I do stream a fair amount of movies and TV shows.</p>

<p>Some of the movies I liked in 2023 are:  <strong>Glass Onion A Knives Out Mystery</strong> (2022), <strong>The Menu</strong> (2022), <strong>The Whale</strong> (2022), <strong>Tetris</strong> (2023), <strong>Dungeons Dragons Honor Among Thieves</strong> (2023), <strong>Creed III</strong> (2023), <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong> (2023), <strong>John Wick Chapter 4</strong> (2023), <strong>Polite Society</strong> (2023), <strong>BlackBerry</strong> (2023), <strong>Nimona</strong> (2023), <strong>Asteroid City</strong> (2023), <strong>Big Bug</strong> (2022), <strong>Spider-Man Across The Spider-Verse</strong> (2023), <strong>Bottoms</strong> (2023), <strong>Totally Killer</strong> (2023), <strong>The Equalizer 3</strong> (2023), <strong>Jules</strong> (2023), <strong>Oppenheimer</strong> (2023), <strong>Killers Of The Flower Moon</strong> (2023), <strong>The Holdovers</strong> (2023), <strong>Finestkind</strong> (2023).</p>

<p>I also watched individual seasons from various TV shows. Excellent ones include: <strong>Wednesday S1</strong> (2022), <strong>The Mandalorian S3</strong> (2023), <strong>The Sandman S1</strong> (2022), <strong>One Piece S1</strong> (2023), <strong>Foundation S1,S2</strong> (2021-2023), <strong>The Fall of the House of Usher S1</strong> (2023).</p>

<h2>🕹️ Gaming</h2>

<p>2023 was a gaming resurgence. Some of these games aren't new, I just happened to buy and play them this year. I have a huge backlog of games, so I can wait very patiently to buy them during sales.</p>

<p>On PC/Mac I really enjoyed: <strong>Last Epoch</strong>, <strong>Halls of Torment</strong>, <strong>Satisfactory</strong>, <strong>Death Must Die</strong>, <strong>Hardspace: Shipbreaker</strong>, <strong>ΔV: Rings of Saturn</strong>.</p>

<p>On Switch I had fun with: <strong>Cult of the Lamb</strong>, <strong>Loop Hero</strong>, <strong>Hades</strong>.</p>

<h2>Twitter and social media</h2>

<p>In 2023, <a href="https://twitter.com/brbcoding">Twitter</a> was dead to me. I stopped posting anything of value. I'm also on <a href="https://indieweb.social/@brbcoding">Mastodon</a>, but to be honest the death of Twitter has completely demotivated me from participating in any kind of social media. I'm also on BlueSky but that place seems dead.</p>

<p>I finished the year with 594 followers on Twitter and 106 followers on Mastodon (double than the end of 2022).</p>

<h2>Things to look forward to in 2024</h2>

<p><strong>Development stuff</strong></p>

<p>Last year I said I was excited about new versions of various tech stacks. I've reached a tipping point and I just wish things would slow down for a change. I'm tired of the never-ending release cycle. My wish is for everyone to take a year off from new releases (who am I kidding tho?).</p>

<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>

<p>This year ChatGPT has been omnipresent, and we've been building heavily on it at work. Going forward, I would also like this space to slow down a little because the implications are disquieting. Again - who am I kidding - change will happen with or without my approval.</p>

<p><strong>Projects</strong></p>

<p>I don't have any specific personal projects in mind. At the very least I'd like to finish or continue polishing the ones that are still WIP after many years.</p>

<p><strong>Games</strong></p>

<p>I have a feeling I'll be gaming more in 2024. I'm burnt out on work and side projects and I need some long-term R&amp;R. I already have a few queued up on the PC: <strong>Witchfire</strong>, <strong>Outer Worlds</strong>, <strong>Noita</strong>, <strong>We Who Are About To Die</strong>, <strong>Astral Ascent</strong>, and on the Switch I might buy <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Health and fitness</strong></p>

<p>Being healthy is good and I'd like to continue that. Likewise with being in shape. In 2024 I hope to expand my running volume (cumulative distance) and keep it on an even keel with cycling and swimming.</p>

<p>That about wraps it up for now. Once again, thank you for your readership dear friends, and lets make 2024 the best year of the 20s yet!</p>
